Excel-based nutrient density analysis using USDA FoodData Central

Nutrient Density Analysis of Branded Foods
Using USDA FoodData Central
Project Overview
This project analyzes branded food products from the USDA FoodData Central database to evaluate nutrient density across food categories. The goal is to move beyond serving-based nutrition labels by standardizing nutrients per gram and identifying calorie-dense, protein-dense, and sodium-heavy food categories.

📁 Dataset
•	Source: USDA FoodData Central (Branded Foods) via Kaggle
•	File Used: food_nutrient.csv
•	Observations: Hundreds of thousands of branded food records

🧰 Tools & Skills
•	Microsoft Excel
•	Power Query
•	Data Cleaning
•	Feature Engineering
•	Pivot Tables
•	Data Visualization
•	Dashboard Design

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
•	Removed products with missing calorie values
•	Standardized serving sizes to grams
•	Engineered nutrient density metrics:
    •Calories per gram
    •Protein per gram
    •Sodium per gram

📊 Analysis Performed
•	Average calories per gram by food category
•	Average sodium per gram by food category
•	Average protein per gram by food category
•	Protein vs calorie scatter plot analysis
•	Dashboard focused on Top 50 food categories for clarity

📈 Key Insights
•	Processed food categories tend to have higher calorie and sodium density
•	Protein density varies widely across food categories
•	High calorie content does not necessarily indicate high protein content
•	Nutrient density provides clearer insight than serving-size labels

🧾 Dashboard
The Excel dashboard consolidates calorie, protein, and sodium analyses into a single view, supported by a scatter plot comparing protein and calorie density.


✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Excel and Power Query can be used to clean large nutrition datasets, engineer meaningful metrics, and generate actionable insights relevant to nutrition science and food processing.
